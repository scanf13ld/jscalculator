Creative Portion:

1. Share calendar:

   Users are able to share their calendar with a user. Doing so will add all their events to the person who they shared with's calendar.
   
2. Repeating events:

   A user may create an event that repeats weekly, monthly, or yearly. They may specify how many times it should repeat (including the first instance of itself).
   
3. Filter by tag:

   A user may choose to filter the events by their specific tags with the filter bar.
   
4. Design

   Icon tags: We added tags for each event. Each tag is associated with an icon that displays on the day of the event.
   Popup window for day: We dedcided to mimic the apple calendar app and just display some sort of indication that there is an event on a certain day (in our case an icon per
   event), and the user may   click on each day to see a popup window detailing the events for the day.
